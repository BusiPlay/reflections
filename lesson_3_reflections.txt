When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
* When I want to share my work with other users
* When I want to backup my work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

* So I can review the work done by contributors, and make decisions about whether I want their work reflected in my local repository, or decide how my work needs to fit in with their changes
