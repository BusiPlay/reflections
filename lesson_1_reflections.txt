How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
    helps to isolate changed lines so you can compare a subset of the file
    can track down different changed lines by date
    
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
    logical sizing of commits are important to understanding changes in history - code is less like documents in that a single change may take days or hours
    cons - requires some discipline to remember to commit appropriately

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
    Git is centered around code, which makes it much more likely to have inter-related changes

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    git log shows you history of commits, git diff can show you the detail of changes made in each commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
    you know you can find where something broke and identify it so you may be more likely to experiment more freely
